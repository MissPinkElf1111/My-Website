			<h2>Skill & Experience</h2>

		<p style="color: pink;">
			All my experience in programming is from my school studying. Thanks to multiple aspects courses provided by KPU, I have learned some basic knowledge of PHP, Python, 
			C++, and Java. I also created a small game by using a graphic programming tool which is Processing. The game is called eating fish. In this game, players need to control
			the goose to eat as many fish as they can to get points. Meanwhile, they need to avoid the traps which can end the game directly.
